# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

Local setup (no Docker):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements/development.txt
npm install && npm run build:css
cp .env.example .env
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

Tests run through `pytest` (config in `pytest.ini`, which pins `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` to `config.settings.test`):

```bash
pytest
pytest apps/authentication/tests/test_models.py::UserProfileModelTests::test_str_returns_email
```

Migrations (after changing any `models/*.py`):

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations authentication   # or whichever app
python manage.py migrate
```

Huey worker (separate terminal, required for background/periodic tasks to actually run):

```bash
python manage.py run_huey
```

Tailwind CSS (source `static/css/src/main.css` → compiled `static/css/dist/main.css`, which is gitignored):

```bash
npm run watch:css   # during development
npm run build:css   # one-off / before Docker build
```

Docker:

```bash
docker compose up --build                              # dev: web + huey, SQLite, no external services
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build    # prod-like: web + huey + postgres + redis
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec web python manage.py migrate
```

## Communicating with the user

The user is a business specialist, not a developer. In all responses (not just final summaries):

- Keep answers short and simple — as brief as possible while still answering the question.
- Avoid technical jargon, code snippets, file paths, and implementation detail unless explicitly asked for them.
- Frame explanations around business value and outcomes (what changed for them, what it enables, what to expect), not how it was built.

## Working conventions

- **Code style lives in `.claude/rules/code-style.md`.** Naming, imports, `X | None` type hints, double quotes, the view/service/serializer split, and domain-exception error handling. Read it before writing Python here.
- **Always enter plan mode for any prompt that isn't a question.** If the user's message is asking you to do something (implement, fix, refactor, add, remove, configure, etc.) rather than purely asking you to explain or answer something, enter plan mode before making any changes — even if the task seems small or the approach seems obvious. Only skip plan mode for genuine questions where no repo changes are being requested.
- Initially ask the user if he wants to use `product-owner` mode, if yes **Run the `product-owner` skill first for feature requests.** For any non-question prompt that requests new or changed functionality, invoke the `product-owner` skill before/while entering plan mode to settle domain requirements through business-focused questions, and use its output as the basis for the plan.
- **Don't build or run Docker unprompted.** `docker compose build`/`up` (dev or prod) is slow and noisy — only do it when the user explicitly asks to build, run, or test something in Docker. Local venv + `manage.py` is the default way to run and verify changes.
- **Every model gets a Django admin registration.** When adding a new `models/<name>.py`, add a matching `@admin.register(...)` `ModelAdmin` in that app's `admin.py` (see `apps/authentication/admin.py:UserProfileAdmin`) in the same change — don't leave new models unregistered.
- **Every environment variable read by the code must be documented in `.env.example`.** Whenever you add or change an `os.environ[...]`/`os.environ.get(...)` call (or any other env var read, e.g. in `docker-compose*.yml`), add or update the matching key in `.env.example` with a safe placeholder/default value in the same change. Use the `env-example-sync` skill to check this.
- **Kydo integration work always goes through the `kydo-api` skill.** Any Kydo client code, tests, or notes on Kydo API behavior belong under `.claude/skills/kydo-api/` (`SKILL.md`, `references/api-quirks.md`, `assets/kydo_client.py`, `assets/test_kydo_client_example.py`) — don't scatter Kydo-related files elsewhere in the repo. Read `references/api-quirks.md` before implementing or changing any Kydo endpoint call, and add newly discovered spec-vs-reality deviations there rather than only as inline code comments.
- **"Login with Helix" work goes through the `helix-auth` skill.** Read `.claude/skills/helix-auth/SKILL.md` (its "In this project" section names the files) before touching the OAuth/PKCE flow, the `HELIX_*` settings, or `apps/shared/interfaces/helix/`. The app's standard authentication is Django's session framework (`DjangoSession`): the callback calls `django.contrib.auth.login()` and every request after is authenticated by the session cookie. Helix `access_token`/`refresh_token` are used only inside the callback and never persisted.
- **Every change ships with tests.** New code gets tests that validate it; a bug fix gets a regression test that fails without the fix. Keep the suite green — it's the long-term stability guarantee. Conventions live in `.claude/rules/testing.md` (integration by default; unit only for `lib/` and other non-Django code).
- **Use the framework's tooling; don't hand-roll what a command generates.** Migrations come from `makemigrations` — hand-edit the generated file only for data migrations or operations the autodetector can't express, never write one from scratch. New apps come from `django-admin startapp`. Before calling a change done, run and clear `manage.py check` (dev + test) and `makemigrations --check --dry-run`.
- **Never wipe or delete data without the user's explicit consent — local database included.** No `flush`, no deleting `db.sqlite3`, no `migrate <app> zero`, no dropping/recreating tables, and no deleting rows — including the superuser or any other `UserProfile` — to "start clean". Treat existing data (local or otherwise) as something to preserve. If a migration problem needs resolving, fix it forward instead.
- **Never change a user's password.** Don't call `set_password`/`save()` on an existing `UserProfile`'s password, don't run `changepassword`, don't reset credentials — not even to debug a login issue.
- **Restart the app when you're done.** After finishing a change, run/restart `python manage.py runserver` so the app is left running the latest code.
- **Apply migrations once tests pass.** After a full `pytest` run succeeds and there are unapplied migrations (new or from `makemigrations`), run `python manage.py migrate` before finishing the change — don't leave migrations pending on a green test run.

## Architecture

### Domain-driven layout, not Django's default per-app layout

Everything lives under `config/` (project config) and `apps/` (domains). Within a domain app, each concern gets **exactly one file**, never one file per model/CRUD operation:

```
apps/<domain>/
    models/<name>.py       QuerySet + Manager + Model, all three in the same file
    lib/<name>.py          auxiliary framework-free classes/functions: no ORM, no Django/interfaces imports, no I/O; unit-tested
    services/<name>.py     one Service class: business logic, calls Managers/QuerySets/interfaces/lib
    views/<name>.py        HTTP concerns only (auth, response shaping); calls the Service, never touches the ORM directly
    serializers/<name>.py  request validation / response shaping
    filters/<name>.py      django_filters.FilterSet
    permissions/<name>.py  authorization helpers/mixins
    tests/test_<name>.py
```

`apps/authentication/*/user_profile.py` is the reference implementation of this pattern — copy its shape when adding a new domain.

`apps/shared` is the base layer: `apps/authentication` and `apps/jobs` may depend on it, but it must never import from them. External system integrations (Helix OAuth today) live under `apps/shared/interfaces/<system>/` — that's the only code allowed to call the external API/SDK directly.

### No DRF

Despite "serializers" and "filters" in the naming, this project does **not** use Django REST Framework. `apps/shared/serializers.py:BaseSerializer` is a small hand-rolled class (`fields()`, `validate_<field>()` hooks, `is_valid()`, `.errors`, `.data`) used for plain-view request validation and response shaping. `django-filter`'s `FilterSet` is used standalone (not DRF's `DjangoFilterBackend`) via `apps/shared/filters.py:SearchFilterMixin` + `BaseFilterSet`. Backend-searched, paginated list endpoints are built on `apps/shared/views.py:SearchEndpointView`, which any domain subclasses by setting `filterset_class`, `result_template_name`, and overriding `get_queryset()` to go through its Service.

### Custom user model

`AUTH_USER_MODEL = "authentication.UserProfile"` (`apps/authentication/models/user_profile.py`). `USERNAME_FIELD = "email"`, no `username` field. `UserProfileManager` extends `BaseUserManager.from_queryset(UserProfileQuerySet)` and implements `create_user`/`create_superuser` — required boilerplate whenever a custom user model changes, since Django's `createsuperuser` depends on it.

### Settings split and the dev/prod engine switch

`config/settings/{base,development,production,test}.py`. The SQLite-vs-Postgres and `SqliteHuey`-vs-`RedisHuey` choice is hardcoded per settings file, not computed from `DEBUG` at runtime — `development.py` and `test.py` use SQLite + `SqliteHuey`, `production.py` requires `DB_*`/`REDIS_*` env vars and uses `RedisHuey`. Django Debug Toolbar is added to `INSTALLED_APPS`/`MIDDLEWARE` **only inside `development.py`**, never conditionally in `base.py` — this is deliberate so it structurally cannot leak into production regardless of `DEBUG`'s value there (`production.py` also has a defensive `assert "debug_toolbar" not in INSTALLED_APPS`).

Logging goes through `l4py` (`LogConfigBuilderDjango` in each settings file). `l4py` defaults to **also** writing a log file to the current working directory even when no `.file(...)` path is configured — `.file_enabled(False)` is set explicitly in `base.py`/`development.py` to keep logging console-only (containers log to stdout). Don't remove that call without deliberately wanting log files on disk. `apps/shared/middleware.py:LoggingContextMiddleware` sets `l4py`'s trace_id/user_id context vars per request, so every log line during a request carries them automatically.

### Huey background jobs

`apps/jobs/tasks/<name>.py` defines tasks with `@db_periodic_task`/`@db_task` from `huey.contrib.djhuey` (the `db_*` variants close stale DB connections after each run — use these, not the plain `task`/`periodic_task` decorators, for anything touching the ORM). Huey's Django integration does not reliably autodiscover task modules, so `apps/jobs/apps.py:JobsConfig.ready()` explicitly imports each task module to force registration — add new task modules to that import list. Tasks call a domain Service (see `heartbeat.py` calling `UserProfileService`), never the ORM directly.

### Frontend: django-cotton + htmx + Alpine.js, no build-time JS framework

Cotton components live in `<app>/templates/cotton/*.html` and are invoked as `<c-component-name attr="...">`, with `<c-vars .../>` declaring props (see `apps/shared/templates/cotton/layout.html` and `searchable_select.html`). htmx and Alpine.js are vendored static files under `static/js/vendor/` (not CDN-loaded), for reproducible offline Docker builds. The searchable-dropdown pattern (`<c-searchable-select>` + `apps/shared/views.py:SearchEndpointView` + a domain's `*_options.html` result partial) is the template for any future backend-searched dropdown — never load full tables client-side for this.

`STATICFILES_DIRS`/cotton's `templates/` auto-discovery mean both project-level (`templates/`, `static/`) and per-app (`apps/*/templates/`, `apps/*/static/`) directories are valid places to add files; app-level is preferred for anything domain-specific.
